Now that our first function is coded, let's deploy it!

We are going to use the `serverless` framework to do so.

Let's install it with  
`npm install -g serverless@2.60.3`{{execute}}

*(This may take a minute or two)*

You can double check that the tool has correctly been installed with  
`serverless --version`{{execute}}
