First, let's create our NodeJS project thanks to the `npm` tool.

Start by creating a new folder and change your current location to this newly created folder with `mkdir workshop && cd workshop`{{execute}}

Then, bootsrap an empty project, using `npm init --yes`{{execute}}

You can verify that a `package.json` has been generated listing all files in the current folder with `ls`{{execute}}

Great! Our project is now bootstraped, let's go to the next step!
